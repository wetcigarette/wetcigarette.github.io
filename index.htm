				<h1>I'm back!!</h1>
				<p class="date">September 10, 2016</p>
				<p>It's been <em>so long</em> since I updated my site... :(</p><p>
				</p><p>But now I'm <em>back! :D</em></p>
				<p>Life's been <em>really</em> busy for me so I haven't had time to work on my site like I want to. There also hasn't been any big new Lily merch lately... :'(</p>
				<p>I <em>DID</em> finally find one of those <em>Water Cuties</em> Lily figures though! I'll take a pic soon and get it up on the toys page. For now, check out all the great <em><strong>new pics</strong></em> I added to the fanart page!</p>

				<h1>Minor updates!</h1>
				<p class="date">May 12, 2015</p>
				<p>I finally found one of those <em>Lily erasers</em> over the weekend, so I've updated the toys page! Now I just have to wait for the new Water Cuties figure to be released sometime this year!</p>
				<p>I don't really understand the appeal of a pony eraser honestly... if you erase stuff with it, it'll get <em>used up</em>! Who would want to wear down their pony like that?! :(</p>

				<p>Heya everypony! Seems like March is the month for <em>merch updates!</em> Lily's back in the Wave 12 blindbag sets and there's a <em>new Lily figure</em> coming out soon!! I've also seen some Lily-shaped erasers on eBay!</p>

				<p>Lily's Flower Garden has been online for a <em>whole year</em> now, so to celebrate I've done a bunch of updates! I'm still not done with everything I want to do.....but maybe that's a <em><strong>good</strong></em> thing! If I was done then I'd have no updates to do! And if I wasn't updating then there would be no reason to come to my site!!</p>
				<p>I hope you all have a <em>wonderful</em> year! Let's make 2015 fun! :D</p>

				<h1>Major fanart update!</h1>
				<p class="date">October 20, 2014</p>
				<p>Busy busy... but I took some time to update! I just added a <em>TON</em> of fanart to the pictures page! In fact, it's pretty much <em><strong>EVERY LILY PICTURE</strong></em> from DeviantArt!!</p>
				<p>There sure is a lot of it! I guess more people know about Lily than I realized! :D</p>
				<p>And I <em>still</em> have more plans for this site! I just need to find time to get to it... but I will eventually! So stay tuned!!</p>

				<h1>We're back!</h1>
				<p class="date">June 16, 2014</p>
				<p>Whoops! It's been a <em>looong</em> time since I updated..... Sorry about that! I didn't forget about the site or anything, I was just <em>soo</em> busy with school and other projects that I didn't have time to work on this! But now I have time because it's <em><strong>SUMMERRR<i>!!</i></strong></em></p>
				<p>I just finished updating Lily's Flower Garden to <em>HTML5</em>! But it doesn't look any different.... It has a new logo though! Anyway, now that <em>THAT</em> update is finally out of the way I can get back to adding more stuff to the site! Yay!!</p>

				<h1>Merchandise news!</h1>
				<p class="date">March 17, 2014</p>
				<p>The <a href="http://myponynews.tumblr.com/post/79852527982/">My Little Pony News</a> blog on Tumblr is reporting that a <em>brushable Lily Blossom figure</em> (and several <em>other</em> lovely ponies!) was found at a Target store in San Francisco! They're apparently <em><a href="http://spiderjewel.tumblr.com/post/79858588210/">not exactly the same</a></em> as the first editions! The ponies come in simple bags instead of the usual packaging and are much <em>cheaper</em> than the current Lily prices online!</p>
				<p>I really hope this is the beginning of a <em>wider release</em>!! Lily is the <em>cutest</em> and <em>best pony</em> and she shouldn't be so rare and expensive!</p>
				<p><em>UPDATE (April 8):</em> I saw someone say that these bagged ponies are now at <em>Walmart</em> so I went to check it out and it's true! Right at the front of the store they have a bunch of cardboard bins and <em>the pony bin has <em><strong>Lilys</strong></em> in it!!</em> But its kind of weird because it doesn't have the pony names anywhere...</p>
				<p>There doesn't seem to be many different ponies in these bags. I think it's just the mane six (but not Twilight?) and Lily and Lyra and Cheerilee. I wonder why they keep bringing back Lily since she still hasn't been in the show! First in a McDonalds set and now this! HMMMM......</p>
				<p>I guess it's because she's <em>BEST PONY</em> ;)</p>

				<p>I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday! Even if you don't have a very special somepony to share it with, you should just go out and have a fun time being awesome! That's what I do!! :D</p>

				<h1>Links page is ready!</h1>
				<p class="date">February 8, 2014</p>
				<p>Hey guys! Today I put up a page of <em>cool sites</em> I like! You can find it <a href="https://lilyblossom.neocities.org/links.htm">here</a>! It's not a whole lot right now but I'll add more over time!!</p>

				<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
				<p class="date">December 31, 2013</p>
				<p>Hi there! I'm <em>Ikewise</em> and this site is dedicated to the cutest, prettiest, all-around <strong>BEST</strong> pony: <em>Lily Blossom!</em> I'm Lily's <em>number one</em> fan!! :D</p>

				<p><em>But</em> not many people know about Lily. :( So I made this site so people could know about her! :)</p>

				<p>The site's <em>still</em> not quite done yet, but I wanted to <em>at least</em> get the basics up for now. But I have more pages on the way, so stay tuned!</p>
